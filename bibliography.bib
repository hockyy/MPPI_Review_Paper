abstract="Electronic voting is an alternative mechanism of ballot based voting which empowers voters to cast their secret and secure vote electronically over a public channel. Many onward-thinking countries are adopting the electronic voting system to upgrade their election process. E-voting system is more complicated to construct. Thus it expects more security as compared to the postal voting system. The objective of the paper is twofold. Firstly, we proposed an efficient blind signature scheme using the identity-based cryptosystem in the random oracle model. The proposed scheme uses the combination of Boldyreva's blind signature scheme and Choon-Cheon's Identity-based signature. Additionally, we reduce its security to the Gap Diffie-Hellman Complexity (GDH). Under the adaptive chosen message and ID attacks it is secure against existential forgery attack. We show our proposed system performed better as compared to existing systems. Secondly, we construct an E-voting system based on our ID-based blind signature and Boneh's short signature scheme (EVS-ID-BS) that fulfills the E-voting security requirements. To the best of our knowledge, EVS-ID-BS is the first practical implementation of E-voting system based on ID-BS Scheme which is constructed in the random oracle model. Proposed EVS-ID-BS scheme provides batch verifiability for a significantly large number of voters, needs less bandwidth cost and require less interaction with election authority.",

ABSTRACT = {A blockchain is a distributed, digitized and consensus-based secure information storage mechanism. The present article provides an overview of blockchain based e-voting systems. The primary purpose of this review is to study the up-to-date state of blockchain-based voting research along with associated possible challenges while aiming to forecast future directions. The methodology applied in the review is a systematic review approach. Following an introduction to the basic structure and features of the blockchain in relation to e-voting, we provide a conceptual description of the desired blockchain-based e-voting application. Symmetrical and asymmetrical cryptography improvements play a key role in developing blockchain systems. We have extracted and reviewed 63 research papers from scientific databases that have advised the adoption of the blockchain framework to voting systems. These articles indicate that blockchain-supported voting systems may provide different solutions than traditional e-voting. We classified the main prevailing issues into the five following categories: general, integrity, coin-based, privacy and consensus. As a result of this research, it was determined that blockchain systems can provide solutions to certain problems that prevail in current election systems. On the other hand, privacy protection and transaction speed are most frequently emphasized problems in blockchain applications. Security of remote participation and scalability should be improved for sustainable blockchain based e-voting. It was concluded that frameworks needed enhancements in order to be used in voting systems due to these reservations.},
